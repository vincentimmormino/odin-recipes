                Though simple, sauteed mushrooms are one of my favorite things in the entire world.
                In a world where we have been blessed by a being as ubiquitous and intelligent as
                fungus, are we <em>not</em> to enjoy what they can offer to us? Mushrooms are a
                beautiful thing. They're not quite a vegetable but they're not quite <em>not</em>
                a vegetable. They're not quite meat but they're not quite <em>not</em> meat. And
                don't even get me started on the world of mycelium beneath our very feet. If there
                is a god, it is mushrooms.

                If you made it this far without giving your screen a weird look and closing this
                tab, then congratulations! It's mushroom time.

        <ol>
            <li>Add butter and oil to a pan and heat on medium-high</li>
            <li>
                Once that is hot, add the mushrooms and soy sauce to the pan and toss the
                mushrooms with the mixture.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let it cook for about 5 minutes, and <em>do not stir</em>, Leave those bad
                boys to brown on one side.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the garlic and rosemary and cook another 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add salt and pepper to taste. You shouldn't need much salt because of the soy
                sauce, so be careful not to add too much.
