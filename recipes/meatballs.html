        <!-- Introduction -->
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            You're in for a treat with this recipe. This one is my family's recipe, passed down
            from my great-great grandparents down to me. It may go even further back than that!
            These meatballs can be made and eatent with pasta, they can be prepared in sauce, or
            they can be eaten as is! Every option is delicious, but personally, I think these meatballs
            are best when eaten as-is directly out of the fryer. (But give them a couple minutes to cool
            down, good god, don't burn your mouth on hot oil.)
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm going to level with you. I don't use concrete measurements when I make meatballs. What I do
            is get a set amount of meat and then proportion everything else relative to the volume of meat that
            I have. I always recommend following the preparation instructions, rolling and frying one test meatball,
            and taste-testing it to make any necessary changes to your mixture before you fry all of them. You
            will develop your meatball senses with time! It is best this way!

        <!-- Ingredients -->
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ground beef, 12& fat</li>
            <li>Breadcrumbs with italian seasoning (1/2 the volume of your meat)</li>
            <li>Parmesan cheese (1/4 the volume of your meat)</li>
            <li>Eggs (1 egg per pound of meat, add more if necessary)</li>
            <li>Parsely, to taste</li>
            <li>Salt (more than you think you need. Do not skimp on the salt.)</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil, enough to fill your pan at least 1/2 inch deep</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Directions -->
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the meat, breadcrumbs, cheese, eggs, parsely, and salt in a bowl until fully combined.</li>
            <li>If you'd like, roll and fry one meatball to taste test. Add to your mixture as needed.</li>
            <li>Roll your mixture into balls, about 1 inch in diameter. Don't make them too big, or they won't cook all the way through.</li>
            <li>Fill a deep pan with enough vegetable oil to submerge the meatballs at least halfway. Heat this up <em>before</em> placing the meatballs.</li>
            <li>Once the oil is hot, put as many meatballs as will fit in the pan. Cook for 5 minutes, then flip the meatballs. Cook for 4-5 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the meatballs from the oil, and place them on a plate or bowl with a paper towel underneath the meatballs to absorb the extra vegetable oil.</li>
            <li>Let them cool then eat as-is, or incorporate them into another recipe! These pair well with the gnocchi recipe on my page.</li>
