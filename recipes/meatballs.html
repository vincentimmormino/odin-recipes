                This is my family's recipe, passed down for generations. These meatballs can be prepared with pasta, in sauce,
                or just eaten as is! Every option is delicious, but
                personally, I think these meatballs are best when eaten as-is directly out of the fryer.
                (But give them a couple minutes to cool down, good god, don't burn your mouth on hot oil.)

            <p>
                I'm going to level with you. I don't use concrete measurements when I make meatballs. What I do
                is get a set amount of meat and then proportion everything else relative to the volume of meat that
                I have. I always recommend following the preparation instructions, rolling and frying one test meatball,
                and taste-testing it to make any necessary changes to your mixture before you fry all of them. You
                will develop your meatball senses with time! It is best this way!

        <!-- Ingredients -->
        <h2 class="subheader">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ground beef, 12& fat</li>
            <li>Breadcrumbs with italian seasoning (1/2 the volume of your meat)</li>
            <li>Parmesan cheese (1/4 the volume of your meat)</li>
            <li>Eggs (1 egg per pound of meat, add more if necessary)</li>
            <li>Parsely, to taste</li>
            <li>Salt (more than you think you need. Do not skimp on the salt.)</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil, enough to fill your pan at least 1/2 inch deep</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Directions -->
        <h2 class="subheader">Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the meat, breadcrumbs, cheese, eggs, parsely, and salt in a bowl until fully combined.</li>
            <li>If you'd like, roll and fry one meatball to taste test. Add to your mixture as needed.</li>
            <li>Roll your mixture into balls, about 1 inch in diameter. Don't make them too big, or they won't cook all the way through.</li>
            <li>Fill a deep pan with enough vegetable oil to submerge the meatballs at least halfway. Heat this up <em>before</em> placing the meatballs.</li>
            <li>Once the oil is hot, put as many meatballs as will fit in the pan. Cook for 5 minutes, then flip the meatballs. Cook for 4-5 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the meatballs from the oil, and place them on a plate or bowl with a paper towel underneath the meatballs to absorb the extra vegetable oil.</li>
            <li>Let them cool then eat as-is, or incorporate them into another recipe! These pair well with the gnocchi recipe on my page.</li>
        </ol>
