# odin-recipes
In this project, I will be designing a basic recipes website. It will look quite ... bare, because as of now, there will not be any CSS involved. However, once this project is finished, I will have demonstrated my ability to create, organize, and link to multiple pages, as well as my ability to effectively use basic formatting tags and accessibility tools.

Update: In this followup project, I have updated this website to include CSS. Through this project I have demonstrated my ability to create classes in CSS, use CSS
selectors, and utilize basic CSS features (fonts, colors, margin, padding) to customize the layout of my website.
The only aspect of this website that goes beyond the scope of what I've learned so far is the images, which are floated to the left. I wanted to keep this project
limited to what I've officially learned so far, but alas, I really wanted the text to wrap around the image.
